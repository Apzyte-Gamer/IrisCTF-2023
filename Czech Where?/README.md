Czech Where?

Iris visited this cool shop a while back, but forgot where it was! What street is it on?

Hint - FYI: flag is all lowercase and _ for spaces. Please remove all accent marks if there are any. Wrap your answer in `irisctf{}`.

So after extracting the tar.gz and then extracting the tar file, I got an image of presumably a wooden product shop. Since the name was written as "Czech Wooden Products", I knew it was in the Czech Republic.

So I went onto google and searched for "Czech Wooden Products" but couldn't find anything.

Therefore, I went onto google maps and searched "Czech Wooden Products", and I found one!

The street name was `Zlatá ulička u Daliborky`.

I formatted the street name to the appropriate format and wrapped it in `irisctf{}`.

And hence the flag!

`irisctf{zlata_ulicka_u_daliborky}`
