Upon first reading the question, I noticed the email `michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com`. I then quickly mailed `michelangelocorning0490@gmail.com` a random text and here's the response he gave me -

```
Dear,

Thank you for the email, I'm currently away on vacation to celebrate New Years! If you would like a quicker response, feel free to reach out to my social media. I mostly talk about birds on it. 

Have a great start to the year, and take care!
```

The response included `feel free to reach out to my social media`. So, I quickly went to Instagram (a guess) and typed in various usernames like `michelangelocorning`, `michel_angelo_corning` and others until finally `michelangelo_corning` actually gave his [Instagram user](instagram.com/michelangelo_corning/).
