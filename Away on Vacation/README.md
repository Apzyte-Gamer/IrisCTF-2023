Dear,

Thank you for the email, I'm currently away on vacation to celebrate New Years! If you would like a quicker response, feel free to reach out to my social media. I mostly talk about birds on it. 

Have a great start to the year, and take care!

I then glided through his posts until finally, I found a special post, containing the text -
