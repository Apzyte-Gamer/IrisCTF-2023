Personal Breach

Security questions can be solved by reconnaissance. The weakest link in security could be the people around you.

Upon opening the website, I saw that we had to find:
- How old Iris was
- Which hospital was she born in
- What company she works for

The decription said `The weakest link in security could be the people around you`. By taking this hint, I went to [michelangelo_corning's Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/michelangelo_corning) and looked at his followers. I then saw [`irisstein_station`](https://www.instagram.com/irisstein_station/) which matched `Iris` so I went further.

I then looked through her posts and found one rather interesting. It said

```
got mimosas with my mom for brunch, love you very much! she didn't want to get instagram ðŸ¤£

Mimosas are one of my favorite drinks, good thing I'm on vacation. We should come back for her birthday in April, a very important date.

@/ElainaStein
```

This made it clear that `Elaina Stein` was Iris's mother and that she wasn't on Instagram. As my gut told me, I went to Facebook (moms = facebook lol), and searched for `Elaina Stein` and boom, I found [her](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555040318052)!

Then I searched through Elaina's page (i am a stalker now lol) and found Iris's Birthdate (April 27, 1996)!
Then after doing some maths, I found Iris's age! 2023 - 1996 = `27`.

Now was time to find her hospital. So I searched through Elaina's posts again and found a post giving her hospital's image. I then went on google image search and found the hospital's exact name! `Lenox Hill Hospital`.

Finally, we had to find Iris's workplace. So I went to Linkedin (because Linkedin = jobs) and searched for Iris Stein and found [her page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iris-stein-57894b2a7/). In there, I found her workplace! `Mountain Peak Hiring Agency`.
